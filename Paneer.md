##Cooking Tips/Variations

* Add 1/2 cup water in step-8 and cook for 3-4 minutes if gravy is too thick.

* You can also use chopped onion instead of using crushed onion for variation.

* You can also add shallow fried paneer cubes. Spread good quality paper napkin or kitchen paper on plate and put shallow fried paneer cubes on it to soak and remove excess oil from it to make relatively healthy low oil curry.

* If you like creamier gravy, then add more milk cream in step-10. Alternatively, if you do not like creamy taste, then you can altogether avoid using cream.

* Paneer is used in this traditional indian curry recipe however, you can use tofu if paneer is not available.
